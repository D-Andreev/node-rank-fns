1. Parse input
  - array of strings values? (this for now)
  - array of file paths, read files

2. Set TF for each document (each document has the sum of TFs for each of the terms in the query)

3. Implement BM25

4. Make functions async
  - Rename to rex
  - extract tfidf and bm25 into a separate class
  - Move k and b as parameters of addon constructor
  - rename existing fns to fnNameSync
  - create async workers for async methods
